        <h2 class="sub-heading">Create  Best Ux Design</h2>
        <p class="post-text">This is another great story that teaches a lesson that’s written for kids but adults can enjoy, too. The story tells of a grasshopper who lounges around all summer while his friend the ant prepares for the winter. When winter comes, the two friends end up in very different situations!

            The moral is that those who save up during the good times will get to enjoy the benefits when times are bad. This very short story from India was originally written in Sanskrit (an ancient language). When a group of doves is caught in a hunter’s net, they must work together as a team to escape from the hunter’s clutches.

            You can listen to a reading of the story as you read along on this website.</p>
